Subject: Constitution of Local Committees to deal with Taxpayers Grievances from High­
Pitched Scrutiny Assessment -reg.-
SirlMadam 
Board has consistently been advising the field authoritie s to be fair, objective and rational 
while framing scrutiny assessment orders. Role of supervisory authorities in this regard. has al.o 
been highlighted by the Board from time to time. It has, however, been brought to the notice of 
Board that the tendency to frame high-pitched and unreasonable assessment orders i< ~till 
persisting due to which grievances are being raised by the taxpayers. Such grievances not onl) 
reflect harassment of taxpayers but also lead to generation of unproductive work for Department 
as well as Appellate Authorities . 
2. In view of the above, a need has been felt to lay down an institutional mechanism to 
quickly resolve the taxpayers' grievances arising on account of high-pitched and unreasonable 
additions made by the Assessing Officers. CBDT has decided that following measures may be 
taken in the field formation for handling taxpayers' grievances arising from high-pitched scrutiny 
assessment orders -
i) Local Committees to deal with Taxpayers Grievances from high-pitched scrutin) 
assessment ('Local Committee') are required to be constituted in each Pr. CCIT region 
across the country. Ideally, the Local Committee may consist of three members of Pr. 
CIT/CIT rank. The members can be selected from the pool of officers posted as PI'. C~I I . 
CIT (Judicial) and CslT (DR), ITAT at the station where the Headquarter s of the 
respective Pr. CC[T is located. The Addl. crr (Headquarters ), to such Pr. CCIT would 
act as a Member -Secretary to the Local Committee. The senior most Member would bc 
designat~d as the Chairman of the Committee. 
ii) The Local Committees so constituted would deal with the grievance petitions related to 
high-pitched scrutiny assessments completed within the Jurisdiction of the respective Pr. 
CCIT. These Committees would also handle the grievances pertaining to Central Charges 
located under the territorial jurisdiction of the PI'. CC[T concerned . 
iii) Similar committees would also be setup in the charges of Pr. ecrr (IntI. Tax.) and ccrr 
(Exemptions). In these committees, the Officers working as CslT (International Ta,,,ation 
Transfer Pricing) and CslT (Exemptions) respectively could be selected as Member,. 
TheAddl. crr (Headquarters ) to Pro CCIT (Inti Tax.)ICCIT (Exemptions) would act as d 
Member -Secretary to these Local Committees.

iv) The Committees may co-opt other members , if necessary . 
v) A grievance petition received by the Local Committee would be immediately 
acknowledged and separate record would be maintained for dealing with such petition ~. 
vi) It shall be the endeavor of the Local Committee to dispose of each grievance petition 
within two months from the end of the month in which such Grievance Petition is 
received by it. 
vii)Thc grievance pctition receivcd by the Local Committee would be examined hy it tll 
asceltain whether there is a prima-fac ie case of high-pitched assessment, non-observance 
of principles of natural justice, non-application of mind, gross negligence or lack or 
involvement of assessing officer. The Committee would ascertain whether the addition 
made in assessment order are not backed by any sound reason or logic, the provisions of 
law have grossly been misinterpreted or obvious and well established facts on records 
have out rightly been ignored. The Committee would also take into consideration 
whether the principles of natural justice have been followed by the assessing officer. 
viii) If it is established that unreasonable and high-pitched additions have been made by the 
assessing officer, a report would be sent to the Pro CClT/Pr. CCIT (Inti Tax.)/CCIT 
(Exemptions), as the case may be, by the Local Committee. The Pro CCIT/CCIT . after 
considering the views of the committee, would take suitable administrative action. 
wherever required. Further, departmental position as determined by the Local 
Committee in such cases would be appropriately presented before the Appellate 
Authorities so that litigation is curtailed. 
ix) It is, however, clarified that the purpose of constitution of Local Committ ee is to 
effectively and efficiently deal with the genuine grievances of taxpayers and help in 
supporting an environment where assessment orders are passed in a fair and reasonable 
manner. The Local Committee, in no way, can be considered to be an alternative 
/additional appellate channel. 
3. The Board has emphasized that the task of constitution of Local Committees be finalized 
in this month itself and a report on compliance may be sent by the Pro CCsIT/Pr. CelT 
(IntI.Tax.)! CCIT(Exemptions) to their respective Zonal Members with a copy to Member (IT). 
CBDT. It has also been desired that the outcome of Local Committee's work may be highlightcd 
in each monthly DOs required to be sent to the Zonal Members.
