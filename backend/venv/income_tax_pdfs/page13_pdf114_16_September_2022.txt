Pr.CClTI CCIT! Pr.DGITI DGlT. As per section 2( ISA) and 2(21) of the Act, Chief

4. Compounding is not a matter of right 
Compounding of offences is not a matter of right. However, offences may be 
compounded by the Competent Authority on satisfaction of the eligibility conditions 
prescribed in these Guidelines keeping in view factors such as conduct of the person, 
the nature and magnitude of the offence in the context of the facts and circumstances 
of each case.

Prosecution instituted under Indian Penal Code(,IPC), if any, cannot be 
compounded. However, section 321 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, provides for 
withdrawal of such prosecution. In case the prosecution complaint filed under the 
provisions of both the Act and the IPC are based on the same facts and, the complaint 
under the Act is compounded , then the process of withdrawal of the complaint under 
the IPC may be initiated by the Competent Authority.
