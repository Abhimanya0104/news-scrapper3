CALENDAR 2023
This calendar is a tribute to India's values of "Vasudhaiva 
Kutumbakam" which has inspired the theme for India's G20 
Presidency: 
'ONE EARTH, ONE FAMILY, ONE FUTURE'
India sees all living beings and even inanimate things as 
composed of 5 basic elements, the Panchtatva – Prithvi (Earth), 
Jal (Water), Vayu (Air), Agni (Fire) and Akaash (Sky).
The photographs in this calendar are all inspired by these 
elements and are taken by ofﬁcers/ ofﬁcials of the Income Tax 
Department
Picture Credits Clockwise (Top Left to Right) : Ms. Monika Khatri (Bikaner), Mr. Jayant Diddi (Bareilly), 
Mr. Ramji Lal Meena (Bangalore), Mr. Raghav Gupta (Delhi), Mr. Jayant Diddi (Bareilly).
