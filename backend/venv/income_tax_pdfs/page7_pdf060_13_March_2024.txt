New Delhi, the 13th March, 2024 
Order under section 119 of the Income-tax Act, 1961-reg. 
The Board is in receipt of applications from entities seeking approval to furnish return of 
income in pursuance to the business reorganisation i.e. scheme of amalgamationlmerger/demerger 
sanctioned by the order of the High Court or Tribunal or an Adjudicating Authority, as defined in 
clause (1) of section (5) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereinafter 'competent 
authority') issued prior to 01.04.2022. In respect of such entities (Le. successor companies), Apex 
Court in Civil Appeal Nos.9496-99 of2019 (arising out ofSLP (C) Nos.l9678-681 of2019) has 
held that the Return of Income filed by the successor companies, after taking into account the 
Scheme of Arrangement and Amalgamation as sanctioned by the NCLT be received. National 
Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has been constituted by the Central Government u/s 408 of the 
Companies Act, 2013 w.e.f. 1 st June, 2016. 
2. Section 170A of the Income-tax Act,1961 (the Act), inserted vide the Finance Act, 2022 
with effect from 1 st April, 2022, provides that the entities going through such business 
reorganization may furnish modified return of income for any assessment year to which such 
order of business reorganisation is applicable, within six months from the end of the month of 
issuance of order of competent authority. The Board vide its order u/s 119 dated 26.09.2022 
allowed successor companies in cases where the order of business reorganisation of the 
competent authority was issued between the period 01.04.2022 to 30.09.2022, to furnish modified 
returns under section 170A of the Act till 31 st March, 2023. The entities, whose scheme of 
business reorganisation has been sanctioned by the competent authority vide orders dated prior to 
01.04.2022 are, therefore, outside the purview of section 170A of the Act. Consequently, these 
entities could not file modified return of income u/s 170A of the Act. 
3. On consideration of difficulties being faced by such entities in electronic filing of return 
of income pursuant to order of the competent authority issued after 01.06.2016 but prior to 
01.04.2022 ('order') and to mitigate their genuine hardship, the Board, hereby allows the 
successor companies to furnish the return with modified particulars (,return') for the relevant­
assessment year( s) in accordance with and limited to the said order by using functionality on e­
filing portal "uls JJ9(2)(b) -after condonation of delay I Court Order or Sanction Order of
