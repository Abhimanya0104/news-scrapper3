•Inclusions ofULIPs inCapital Asset
AULIP isconsidered acapital asset only when the exemption under Section 10(10D)does not apply due
tothe4thand 5thprovisos therefor .Consequently, such ULIPs aresubject tocapital gains taxation .
The reference tothe phrase“on account ofthe applicability ofthe fourth and fifth provisos thereof” from
sub-clause (c)ofSection 2(14)isremoved tobroaden itsapplicability toULIPs inallinstances where the
exemption under Section 10(10D)isnot available .Consequently, allULIPs not qualifying forexemption
under Section 10(10D)willbeclassified ascapital assets .
Acorresponding amendment has been made toSection 45(1B)totaxthe income arising from receipt of
amount under ULIPs, where the exemption under Section 10(10D)isnot available, under the head of
capital gains .
•ULIPs toBeConsidered Equity -Oriented Fund

scheme ofamutual fund specified under Section 10(23D)orunder ascheme ofaninsurance company
comprising ULIPs that donot qualify forexemption under Section 10(10D)due tothe applicability ofthe

term gains arising from the transfer ofcapital assets to12.5%forallassessees ,whether resident ornon-
resident, with effect from 23-07-2024 .

capital gains not referred toinSection 112Awere retained at10%.Section 115ADisamended toprovide

Section 2(14)oftheITAdefines theterm“capital asset .”Securities held byaForeign Institutional Investor
that has invested insuch securities asper the regulations made under the SEBI Act, 1992 ,are also
defined ascapital assets .There issome uncertainty inthe characterisation ofincome arising from
transactions insecurities byinvestment funds .Should such income beconsidered capital gains or
business income forinvestment funds (asspecified inExplanation 1(a)toSection 115UB)?
Section 2(14)isamended toclarify that any security held byinvestment funds referred toinSection
115UB and invested asper the regulations made under the SEBI Act orthe International Financial
Services Centres Authority Act 2019 (IFSCA) shall betreated only asacapital asset .Therefore, any

--- Page 19 ---
The Finance Act 2025 substitutes the word“pending” with“required tobemade” with effect from 01-
02-2025 .Thus, where the assessment proceedings are not pending onthe date ofthe subsequent
search orrequisition but will berequired tobemade, the AOcannot start anew block assessment .
Where the Court/Tribunal invalidates the search action and, inturn, rejects the assessment
proceedings, the AO can initiate anew block assessment proceeding pursuant tothe subsequent
search orrequisition .
•Revival ofabated proceedings
Section 158BA(2)/(3)ofthe Act provides that any assessment, reassessment, recomputation ,or
reference toTPO under Section 92CA(1)oranorder under Section 92CA(3)pertaining toany
assessment year falling inthe block period pending onthe date ofinitiation ofthe search ormaking

for the block period have been annulled inappeal orany other legal proceeding, then, the
assessment orreassessment relating toany assessment year which was abated under Section
158BA(2)/(3)shall revive .
Section 158BA(5)provided forthe revival ofassessment orreassessment post annulment ofthe block
assessment proceedings but did not include the reference torecomputation orreference toTPO
under Section 92CA(1)oranorder under Section 92CA(3),which also got abated due toinitiation of
block assessment .The Finance Act 2025 aligns sub-sections (2)/(3)with sub-sections (5)byadding the
words“recomputation”, “reference”, or“order” insub-sections (5)ofSection 158BA.Thus, allactions
and proceedings abated can now berevived iftheblock assessment proceedings areannulled .

--- Page 20 ---
•Computation oftotal income ofblock period
Section 158BBcontains theprovision forcomputing thetotal income oftheblock period .The previous
provision provided acircuitous approach tocompute thetotal income and undisclosed income ofthe
block period .Itdeduced undisclosed income byexcluding disclosed income from total income .
Section 158BB, assubstituted bythe Finance Act 2025 ,provides anew methodology tocompute the
undisclosed income forthe block assessment with retrospective effect from 01-09-2024 byinserting
sub-section (1A),substituting sub-sections (1),(3)and (5),amending sub-section (2)and omitting sub-
section (6).The new provision does not follow the circuitous method offirst computing the total
income, including disclosed and undisclosed income, and then reducing the disclosed income from
such total income .Itprovides astraightforward method tocompute the undisclosed income, which
shall bethe aggregate ofundisclosed income declared bythe assessee and determined bythe
assessing officer .
•Basis ofincome where return filing isnotmandatory
Anew clause (d)has been inserted inSection 158BB(1A)bythe Finance Act 2025 toprovide that the
income ofcertain assesses shall beconsidered disclosed income where return filing forthem isnot
mandatory, and the tax isdeducted from such income .The incomes that shall beconsidered
disclosed income under this provision shall beasfollows :
(a)Where thetotal income ofanon -resident oraforeign company consists only ofincomes specified
under Section 115A.
(b)Where thetotal income ofanNRI consists only ofincome derived from foreign exchange assets or
long -term capital gain arising from the transfer ofsuch assets and istaxable under the special
regime provided inChapter XIIA (Section 115Cto115-I).
(c)Where the total income ofaresident senior citizen consists ofthe pension income and interest
income received orreceivable from any account maintained inthe bank responsible for
deduction oftaxunder Section 194P.

--- Page 21 ---
•Powers given totheAOtoextend theperiod tofilethereturn ofincome fortheblock period
Section 158BC(1)(a)provides that the Assessing Officer must issue anotice tothe person searched or
whose documents/assets are requisitioned, requiring him tofileareturn declaring hisundisclosed
income forthe block period .The notice requires him tofurnish the return within the prescribed
period but not exceeding 60days .The return must befiled within the time prescribed bythe AO, and
nopowers were previously given tohim toextend thetime .
With retrospective effect from 01-09-2024 ,the Finance Act 2025 inserts afifth proviso toSection
158BC(1)(a)toenable the extension inthe time allowed tofilethe return byafurther period of30days
ifthefollowing conditions arefulfilled :
(a) The due date forfurnishing the return ofthe previous year immediately preceding the year of
search orrequisition has not expired before the date ofinitiation ofthe search orthe date of
requisition ;
(b) The assessee isliable foraudit under section 44ABforsuch previous year ;
(c) The accounts (maintained inthe normal course) ofsuch previous year have not been audited on
thedate ofissuance ofsuch notice ;and
(d) The assessee requests inwriting foranextension oftime forfurnishing such areturn sothat he
may getsuch accounts audited .

--- Page 22 ---
•Limitation period forcompletion ofblock assessment
Section 158BEprovides that the order under Section 158BCmust bepassed within twelve months
from theend ofthemonth inwhich thelast authorisation forasearch under Section 132orrequisition
under Section 132Awas executed ormade .For other persons referred toinSection 158BD, the AO
must complete theassessment within twelve months from the end ofthe month inwhich the notice
under Section 158BCwas issued tosuch person .
Search and seizure proceedings generally require coordinated investigations and assessments .The
current time limit often leads tomultiple time -barring dates, making itdifficult toconclude the cases
logically .Therefore, theFinance Act 2025 changes thetime limit forcompleting theblock assessment
totwelve months from the end ofthe quarter inwhich the last authorization forsearch orrequisition
was executed .
Further, the Finance Act 2025 inserted asecond proviso toSection 158BE(1)togive anextension in
the limitation period tocomplete the block assessment where such anextension of30days isgiven .
Insuch acase, the period oflimitation shall bethirteen months from the end ofthe quarter inwhich
the last authorisation forasearch orrequisition isexecuted ormade .Asimilar second proviso has
been inserted into Section 158BE(3)toextend the limitation period forthe completion ofblock
assessment inthecase ofother person .

--- Page 23 ---
•Extension inthelimitation period
Section 158BE(4)(i)provides that the period during which the assessment proceedings arestayed by
anorder orinjunction ofany court shall beexcluded from the limitation period forcompletion ofthe
assessment .The Finance Act 2025 provides that the period tobeexcluded shall commence onthe
date onwhich theassessment proceeding isstayed byanorder orinjunction ofany court and end on
the date onwhich the jurisdictional Principal CITorCITreceived acertified copy ofthe order vacating
the stay .Asimilar amendment has been made toSection 158BFA, which prescribes the limitation
period tolevy interest and penalty inblock assessment .
•Omission ofSection 158BI
The Finance Act 2025 omitted Section 158BIwith retrospective effect from 01-09-2024 .Section 158BI
provided that the provisions ofChapter XIV-Bdonot apply tosearches initiated orrequisitions made
before 01-09-2024 .
•Curative Amendment
With retrospective effect from 01-09-2024 ,the Finance Act 2025 makes the curative amendments in
various provisions tosubstitute theterm "total income" with "total undisclosed income” .

income received byitfrom aspecial purpose vehicle (inthe case ofboth REITs and InvITs ),and rental
income (for REITs) .The total income ofabusiness trust ischarged totaxatthe maximum marginal

occurring over several years aresimilar and repetitive innature .These transactions involve the same
enterprises, functions, asset and risk analysis (FAR), and the same ALP determination .This creates
unnecessary compliance and administrative burdens forboth assessees and theTPO .
The Finance Act 2025 introduced provisions tocarry out TPanalysis over ablock ofthree years :the
financial year inquestion (the first year) and two consecutive years immediately following (later years) .
The provisions apply from AY2026 -27and subsequent AYs.The procedure forthe same isexplained

inthe first year tosimilar transactions inlater years .The AOwill also recompute the assessee's
total income forthelater years onreceipt oftheorder ofTPO .
d)No reference shall bemade toTPO byAO for computation ofALP inrelation tosuch
transactions forsubsequent years forwhich option isexercised .
