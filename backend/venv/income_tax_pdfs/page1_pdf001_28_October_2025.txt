Committee (PAC) report of 17th Lok Sabha. At para 3.4 of the C&AG's Performance audit report 
No. I of 2019 on "Assessment ofassesses in entertainment sector", it was pointed out that there was 
no uniformity in allowing pre-operative expenses by the Assessing Officers (A Os) despite the facts 
and -circumstances being similar in nature indicating inconsistent approach adopted by Assessing 
Officers in similar cases. 
2. The entertainment sector consists of different segments under its fold such as television, 
radio, music, event management, films, animation and visual effects, broadcasting, sports and 
amusement etc. Therefore, expenses incurred by various segments of the entertainment sector may 
be examined on a case-to-case basis specific to the nature of business undertaken by assessees. 
Some of the issues (non-exhaustive) in respect to such expenses are suggested for examination by 
AOs as under: 
2.1 Pre-operative expenses: These expenses are generally incurred before commencement of 
businesses (pre-operative expenses), which may be examined w.r.t actual commencement of its 
businesses of assessees engaged in the entertainment sector under the provisions of section 32D of 
the Income-tax Act, 1961 for allowance of such pre-operative expenses for amortisation under that 
section. 
2.2 Declaration of expenses of feature film: 
(a) Assessees involved in production of feature films are required to furnish Form No. 52A, 
within thirty days from the end of the financial year or within thirty days from the date of

from him to each person engaged in the production of the film as employee or otherwise. 
(c) The Assessing Officer may verify the submission of Form No. 52A and expenses claimed 
in books of account of these entities. A penalty u/s 272A of the Act for failure to furnish Form No. 
52A within the prescribed time may also be considered by the A Os. 
2.3. Expenses incurred on production of feature films:

(b) As per Rule 9A of the Rules, the cost of production of a feature film may be allowed as
