Foreword by the Chairman, CBDT  
 
The Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) programme of the CBDT, is one of its leading programmes 
for fostering a tax regime in India that provides an investor conducive environment. 641 APAs have 
been entered into by the CBDT till March, 2024, which demonstrates the widespread acceptance of 
the programme by taxpayers and stakeholders alike. In continuation of the exemplary performance 
last year, FY 2023 -24 witnessed the highest number of APA signings in any single year since the 
commencement of the APA programme.  
 
Over more than a decade long period of its existence, the APA programme has contributed 
significantly to the Government of India’s mission of promoting ease of doing business, especially for 
Multi -National Enterprises ( MNEs ), which have transactions spanning across borders, within their 
group entities. Each signed APA brings tax certainty for a taxpayer that spans multiple years. The 
number of APAs signed till date have cumulatively brought about certainty to taxpayers for more than 
3,400 Assessment Years.  
 
Apart from running the Unilateral leg of the APA programme successfully, the CBDT has also 
actively engaged with its various tax treaty partners to negotiate and enter into Bilateral APAs, which 
provide taxpayers an added benefit of relieving double taxation  and providing tax certainty in both 
treaty partner jurisdictions . The year also saw a record number of bilateral agreements signed , which  
is also a testament to the strengthening of our relationship with taxpayers and treaty partners.  
 
As we release this Report, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the hard work and 
dedication of the officers in the Foreign Tax & Tax Research Division of the CBDT and the officers 
in the APA teams under Principal CCIT (International Taxation). I would also like to thank the 
taxpayers for being equal and active partners in this programme. CBDT will continue to strive 
towards further increasing the efficacy of the APA programme and  attain more expedient out comes 
going forward . All f eedback/suggestions on th is Report are welcome, and will help us in further 
strengthen ing the APA programme.

 ng Agreement (APA) programme of the CBDT , is one of its leading programmes for fostering tax 
regime in India that provides an investor conducive environment . 516 APAs have been entered into 
by the CBDT till March, 2023, which demonstrates the wide spread acceptance of the programme by 
taxpayers and tax practitioners . This year witnessed the highest number of APA signing s in any single 
year since the commencement  of the APA programme. Over the more than decade long period of its 
existence, the APA  programme has contributed significantly to the Government of India’s mission of 
promoting ease of doing business, especially for MNEs which have transactions spanning across 
borders within their group entities . Each signed APA brings tax certainty for an individual taxpayer 
that spans multiple years. The number of APAs signed till date have cumulatively brought about 
certainty for more than 3200  assessment years. In the absence of APAs , a major part of these years 
would have still been subject to protracted litigation . 
Apart from running the Unilateral leg of the APA programme  successfully , the CBDT has also 
actively engaged with its various tax treaty partners to negotiate and enter into Bilateral APAs, which 
provide the taxpayers an added benefit of relieving double taxation.  The record number of bilateral 
agreements signed this year is a testament to our strengthening relationship with taxpayers and treaty 
partners.  
As we release this Report, I would like to place on record my appreciat ion of  the hard work  and 
dedication of the officers in the Foreign Tax & Tax Research Division of the CBDT and the officers 
in the APA teams under Principal CCIT (International Taxation). I would also like to express my 
gratitude to  the taxpayers for being equal and active partners in this programme.  I assure all 
stakeholders that the CBDT will continue to strive towards further increas ing the efficacy of  the APA 
programme.  I invite stakeholders to provide  their feedback/suggestions which, I believe, will help us 
in identifying the ways to further strengthen  the APA programme.

Preface by Member ( L), CBDT  
 
The Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) programme was introduced in India through Finance Act, 
2012 with a view to fulfil the objectives of tax certainty and double taxation avoidance - two key 
focus areas of the CBDT for several years now. Being founded on principles of mutual co -operation 
and trust between taxpayers and revenue authorities, the programme has strengthened the Indian tax 
administration's orientation of enabling and empowering, the growth of our taxpayers.  
 
The programme has constantly strived for a meticulous, positive, fact -intensive and collaborative 
perspective on transfer pricing , aided by consultation and a desire on convergence and acceptability of 
outcomes . Thus, a more cooperative rather than adversarial approach, forms the cornerstone of the 
APA programme.  
 
It gives me immense pleasure to present this sixth  Annual Report (for FY 202 3-24) of the Indian APA 
programme. This Annual Report presents abundant numerical data and detailed analysis that confirms 
the immense popularity and acceptability of the APA programme in India. The year FY 202 3-24 in 
particular has been one of resounding success for the programme with several milestones in terms of 
number of signings surpassed  in unilateral as well as bilateral agreements . 
 
I would   like to congratulate the officers in the Foreign Tax & Tax Research Division of the CBDT 
and the APA teams under Principal CCIT (International Taxation)  for their successful work . This 
financial year has been a record -breaking year for the APA programme in many respects, with the 
highest number of signings in any year in the history of the programme , for which I would like to put 
on record my special appreciation for the dedication and hard work of the officers, as well as the 
positive support extended by taxpayers and tax consultants. I would specifically also like to thank our 
taxpayers for reposing their faith in the APA programme and extending their full -fledged cooperation 
in ensuring that the programme continues to be a success.

 Chapter 1: APA Programme  of India – Introduction  
 
An Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) is an agreement between the tax administration and a person 
(taxpayer), which determines, in advance, the Arm’s Length Price ( ALP ) or specifies the manner of 
the determination of ALP (or both), in relation to an international transaction1. APA programmes are 
operational in a number of countries for a long time . The primary goal of such programmes is to 
provide certainty to taxpayers in respect of the pricing of cross -border transactions undertaken by 
taxpayers with their group entities.  
Unprecedented growth in international trade  involving cross -border transactions within group entities  
has given rise to numerous tax disputes on the issue of transfer pricing. An APA is a mechanism to 
resolve transfer pricing disputes in advance, i.e., before the cross -border related party transaction 
actually takes place or, at least, before a dispute arises in respect of such cross -border transaction. The 
transfer price of goods and services transacted between group entities is decided in advance by the tax 
authorities and the taxpayers, so as to prevent any dispute arising from such transfer pricing.  
The APA programme is carried out in India with a legislative mandate under the Income -tax Act, 
1961.  It was launched in 2012 through the insertion of sections 92CC and 92CD in the Income -tax 
Act, 1961  by the Finance Act, 2012 . These statutory provisions, effective from 1st July, 2012, lent the 
legal backing to the CBDT to enter into APAs with taxpayers for a maximum period of 5 years in 
respect of international transactions between Associated Enterprises (AEs) to determine the  ALP or to 
specify the manner in which the ALP is to be determined.  
Vide notification no. 36/2012 [F. No. 133/5/2012 -SO(TPL)]/SO 2005 (E), dated 30th August, 2012, 
the APA Scheme [Rules 10F to 10T] was inserted in the Income -tax Rules , 1962  to operationalize the 
APA programme. Thus, the Indian APA programme, which commenced from 1st July, 2012, became 
fully functional and operational from 30th August, 2012 with the notification of the rules. The rules 
deal with the various procedural aspects of the APA process, including procedures for filing of pre -
filing consultation application; pre -filing consultation; payments of fees; filing of APA application; 
processing of APA application; withdrawal of APA application; terms and conditions of APA; filing 
of Annual Compliance Report; Compliance Audit; revision, cancellation and renewal of APA; etc.  
Rollback provisions allow the ALP or the methodology for determining the ALP as agreed to in the 
APA, to be rolled back to a period prior to the commencement of the APA. Roll -back of APAs was 
announced by the Government on 10th July, 2014. The necessary legislative changes in this regard 
were carried out through the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2014. The amendment to the Income -tax Rules , 
1962  for implementing the Roll -back provisions were notified on 14th March, 2015 and the existing 
APA Scheme got amended accordingly. The Rollback provisions are applicable for a maximum of

 four years prior to the first year of the APA period. Thus, a taxpayer would be able to have certainty 
in matters of transfer pricing for a maximum period of 9 years at any one time by applying for an 
APA with Rollback provisions. Circular No. 10 of 2015 was issued by the CBDT on 10th June, 2015 
to provide clarity on Rollback issues in the form of answers to FAQs.  
Under the Indian APA programme, APAs can be unilateral , involving the CBDT only , or bilateral , 
involving CBDT and the tax authorities of another country . Bilateral APAs are based on Agreements 
entered into by the Competent Authority of India with the Competent Authority of the treaty partner 
jurisdiction, thereby extending tax certainty simultaneously in both the jurisdictions. Over the last 12 
years, more than 1800 applications have been filed in India. About 75% of these are for unilateral 
APAs between the Indian taxpayer and the CBDT. Till 31st March, 202 4, 641 Agreements have been 
entered into , of which  506 are unilateral and 135 are bilateral.  
The APA applications are processed and analysed by dedicated APA teams working under the overall 
supervision of Pr. CCIT (International Taxation), New Delhi. Each APA team is headed by a 
Principal Commissioner/ Commissioner of Income -tax. The team also comprises Addl./Joint 
Commissioners of Income -tax and Deputy/Asst. Commissioners of Income -tax. Presently, there are 
five APA teams. These teams are based in Delhi, Mumbai , Bengaluru  and Gurgaon .  
In respect of unilateral APAs  (UAPAs) , the position papers developed by the APA teams are 
approved by the Pr. CCIT (International Taxation), New Delhi and sent to the CBDT for approval. In 
the CBDT, officers of the Foreign Tax & Tax Research (FT & TR -I and II) Divisions examine and 
process the position papers /report received under Rule 10L . Joint Secretary, FT & TR -I and FT & TR -
II review the examination done by the officers below and further process the position papers before 
sending it for final approval of the designated Member of the CBDT. The Member approves the final 
negotiating position to be adopted by the APA teams. Once the negotiation is complete, a draft 
Agreement is sent to the CBDT for approval. Thereafter, the Agreement is entered into between the 
CBDT and the taxpayer.  
In respect of bilateral APAs  (BAPAs) , once the position papers are sent to the FT & TR -I & II 
Divisions by the Pr. CCIT (International Taxation), the Competent Authority of India (either Joint 
Secretary, FT & TR -I or Joint Secretary, FT & TR -II, depending upon the country with which the 
bilateral APA is to be negotiated) initiates discussions with their counterpart in the other country. The 
officers in the FT & TR Division of the CBDT working with the Competent Authority examine the 
position paper received from the Pr.CCIT (International Taxation) and prepare the position of the 
Indian Competent Authority. The same is shared with the Competent Authority of the other country. 
Once positions have been exchanged, the Competent Authorities of both countries discuss and 
negotiate the terms and conditions of the APA. If they reach an understanding, then a Mutual 
Agreement, containing the terms and conditions of the APA, is entered into by the Competent 

--- Page 10 ---
 
Page 10 of 43 
 Authorities of both countries. Thereafter, each country usually enters into an Agreement with its own 
taxpayer. On the Indian side, the terms and conditions of the Mutual Agreement are shared with the 
taxpayer and its concurrence is sought within 30 days. Once the taxpayer agrees to the resolution 
reached in the Mutual Agreement, a draft Agreement is prepared in consultation with the Indian 
taxpayer and the same is submitted for the approval of the designated Member in the CBDT.  
For both UAPAs and BAPAs , the Agreements are entered into by either Joint Secretary, FT & TR -I or 
Joint Secretary, FT & TR -II (the two Competent Authorities of India) with the taxpayer, on behalf of 
the CBDT.  
The sixth  Annual Report on the APA programme highlights the progress made in financial year 202 3-
24. This has been a nother  successful  year for the APA programme. This year  again , CBDT recorded 
the highest ever APA signings in any financial year since the launch of the APA programme, signing 
a total of 125 APAs. This year, CBDT also signed the maximum number of BAPAs in any financial 
year till date, with the signing o f 39 BAPAs. The BAPAs were signed as a consequence of entering 
into Mutual Agreements with India’s treaty partners namely Australia, Canada, Denmark,  Japan, 
Singapore, the UK and the US . This was made possible  by the efforts of the CBDT and its officers 
working in the Foreign Tax & Tax Research Division and the APA teams [under the Principal CCIT 
(International Taxation )]. The CBDT also acknowledges the cooperation and efforts of the taxpayers 
and their consultants in making the APA programme a success.  
This Annual Report carries forward the CBDT’s unique initiative to bring into the public domain 
various statistical and qualitative aspects of India’s APA programme. The idea is to acknowledge that 
there is still a great scope for further improvements in this programme and encourage discussion and 
debate amongst taxpayers, policy makers, and economists, among others, on its strengths and 
weaknesses. This Annual Report also underlines the importance that the APA programme holds in the 
Government’s endeavour to promote and preserve a non -adversarial tax regime  by working with the 
stakeholders .

2.1       Applications filed  
The total number of applications filed on an annual basis can be seen from Table 2 -1 and Figure 2 -1 
below. The total number of BAPA filings in FY 2022 -23 and FY 2023 -24 has increased as seen from 
the rise in number of applications filed compared to previous years. Although premature to declare 
this as a trend based on one year, the shift towards BAPAs indicates confidence in the quick and 
efficient resolutions with many of our treaty partners.

 2.4 Total covered years in Agreements signed  
The impact of the APA programme  in increasing the ease of doing business is evident from the 
number of years for which it has brought certainty in transfer pricing matters and reduced litigation. In 
its short period of existence in India, the APA programme  has cumulatively brought about certainty 
for over 3400 years.

The APA programme is also an important tool to decongest the tax tribunals and higher judiciary of 
transfer pricing litigation. Even if we assume that only about half of these assessment years would 
have ended up in litigation, the APA programme has managed to prevent or resolve this litigation for 
more than 1 700 assessment years . In other words , more than 1 700 transfer pricing matters were 
prevented from getting into litigation . During the last financial year itself, the  APA programme has 
provided tax certainty in respect of more than  700 assessment years.

3.2 Status of Applications Filed  
The number of UAPAs disposed off  and number  of UAPAs  still under processing are detailed in 
Table 3 -2 and Figure 3 -2 below. The figures therein represent the gradual and ongoing evolution of 
the APA Programme, its increasing efficacy as well as the further progress that needs to be aspired in 
respect  of it. The disposal of applications filed in earlier years is high while number of cases still 
under processing is low. For recent years, a large proportion of cases are still under processing. One 
reason for this is that the processing of APAs involves conducting site visits, various due diligence 
processes, and multiple rounds of negotiations, and the need for different stakeholders to come to an 
agreement. A ll of these take time.   
The number of  pending applications also include cases where the applicant has not been responsive to 
queries of the APA team or has not shown much interest in engaging in the APA process, but has also 
not withdrawn its application , leading to a lack of progress . Nevertheless, the absolute number of 
APAs concluded has steadily risen over the past few years, showing progress in the speed and 
efficacy of their resolution.  Nearly 20% of the applications under processing pertain to applications 
filed in March 202 4 and so the processing in these cases is at a preliminary stage.

3.4 Duration of Processing  
The number of UAPAs  signed in FY 2023-24 segregated on the basis of duration taken from 
application to signing are mentioned in Table 3 -4-1 below. It is seen that the average duration for 
closure of applications in FY 2023-24 is approximately  54.65 months . The average duration of 
processing on a cumulative basis is approximately 45.97 months . In the recent years, the focus of the 
APA programme has been on closure of backlog as well as more complex cases  pending for a longer 
duration . The average duration of processing of cases in FY 20 23-24, when compared to cumulative 
figure, highlights the impact of these factors.

3.5 Sectoral distribution of applicants  
The primary economic activity of applicants in whose cases UAPAs  were signed in FY 2023-24 are 
mentioned in Table 3 -5 below. As can be seen , a majority of applications which culminated into 
agreement in FY 2023-24 pertain to the service sector. A majority of these, in turn, are captive 
companies involved in software development and IT enabled services. Some of these companies are 
also involved in engineering design services,  contract  R&D services, and Knowledge Process 
Outsourcing (KPO). It may be noted that 19 out of the 86 companies with which CBDT entered into 
agreements also have manufacturing activities. Further, 25 out of 86 companies are involved in 
trading activities. Hence, the entire spectrum of trading, manufacturing, and services, are covered 
under UAPAs signed.  13

3.6 Industry -wise distribution of agreements  
A majority of UAPAs  signed in the financial year 202 3-24 pertain to the I -T industry, banking & 
insurance, engineering services , telecommunication and power and energy . This reflects on the fact 
that India is a major outsourcing destination for information technology and business processes, and 
significant number of foreign MNEs have presence in I -T clusters of India such as Bengaluru, 
Hyderabad, Chennai, Gurgaon, and Noida. The industry -wise distribution of UAPAs is as given in

3.7 Nature of Transactions Covered  
The nature of the 224 international transactions covered by the 86 UAPAs  signed in FY 2023-24 are 
mentioned in Table 3 -7 and Figure 3 -7 below. As can be seen from the table, a wide variety of 
transactions have been covered by the UAPAs signed in this year . A diversified basket of 
international transactions indicates the growing maturity of the APA programme and competence of 
the APA teams in processing applications that include complex transactions.  
 
While captive services  like SWD services and ITeS services  are usually benchmarked at cost plus 
mark -up under the Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM), the determination of arm’s length 
price for manufacturing, royalty transactions, IGS, etc.  is more intricate. Some complex transactions 
need to be benchmarked using multiple methods (a primary method and a secondary method for 
sanity check).

 3.9 Location of AEs  
The 86 UAPAs  entered into in the financial year  have AEs across 74 countries , as given in Table 3 -9 
below . Usually, a single APA covers AEs located in multiple jurisdictions. The transactions with 
these AEs could be the primary covered international transaction, or a closely linked transaction like 
reimbursement/recovery of expenses, etc. In a majority of cases, AEs are located in the United States,  
the United Kingdom, France , Germany , etc. The APA applicants are usually a part of MNE groups, 
whose parent jurisdictions are in these countries . Many AEs are also located in investment and 
business hubs such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Ireland .

The detailed analysis of this is depicted in Table 4 -6-1 and Figure 4 -6-1 below. With intense 
negotiations with treaty partners , longstanding BAPAs were successfully concluded in this year , but 
the overall time taken in their resolution led to a high average processing time for the year. However, 0128911

 there was also a simultaneous focus on more expedient resolution of renewals in order to leverage the 
due diligence already done recently while processing original applications and ensure movement in a 
mixed -basket of cases. The average time taken for all BAPAs  concluded till 31st March, 202 4 is 
approximately 63.11 months . A number of BAPAs are actually resolved much before they are finally 
signed. However, due to several reasons such as the desire of the applicants to conclude both the 
unilateral and bilateral legs of the application together, the Applicant waiting to clear the draft of 
agreements through multiple levels of internal approvals etc., the formal signing takes longer even 
after bilateral resolution, which increases the final duration of processing of BAPAs.

4.11 Renewal of BAPAs  
 
A large number  of the applicants who have signed a BAPA with the CBDT have opted to file a 
renewal. This shows the trust reposed by the taxpayers in the APA programme and the preference for 
obtaining advance certainty rather than undergoing possible TP litigation and its related costs . Out of 
the 135 BAPAs signed till 31.03.202 4, 66 applicants have opted for a renewal of the APA till date.

 Chapter 5: Other dispute resolution processes  
 
Another dispute resolution channel available under India’s Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements 
(DTAAs) is the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP). It is an alternate dispute resolution process 
involving two treaty partners, that seeks to remove taxation not in accordance with the DTAA arising 
from action by one or both treaty partners. India participates in the FTA MAP Forum of the 
Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and shares its MAP statistics with 
the Forum. The statistics are available in the public domain.  
MAP cases are negotiated by the Competent Authorities of India, namely the Joint Secretary 
(FT&TR -I) and Joint Secretary (FT&TR -II) in the CBDT, and other officers supporting them in this 
regard. The inventory of MAP cases in calendar year 2023 as also reported under MAP statistics with 
the OECD is detailed in Table 5 -1 below. As can be seen from the table, the number of MAP cases 
closed in 2023 are substantially more than the number of new MAP applications invoked. As a result, 
the total number of MAP in India’s inventory is gradually reducing.

As can be seen from Figures 5 -1 and 5 -2, the re has been a steady decline in closing inventory and a 
substantial  number of cases being resolved under MAP each year. This is primarily due to the 
maturing of our relationships with treaty partners  and efforts to increase frequency of communication 
with our treaty partners .

Conclusion  
 
The Indian APA programme is a very important  part of CBDT’s efforts to enhance the ease of doing 
business in India  and providing tax certainty to taxpayers . Since its commencement in July, 2012, the 
APA programme has resolved many complex transfer pricing issues which were otherwise prone to 
long drawn and expensive litigation.  
The Indian APA programme has successfully achieved resolutions that are beneficial to both 
taxpayers and the Government. While taxpayers have managed to get certainty over transfer pricing 
issues for five to nine years (depending upon whether rollback provisions are applicable to an 
Agreement), the Government has been able to streamline  limited resources on more productive work, 
including audit s and other procedures.   
APAs are also beneficial to the Government , as they assur e tax revenues from multinationals on the 
basis of the terms and conditions embedded in the Agreements , without any further disputes and 
litigation . Though revenue mobilisation has never been the primary objective of the Indian APA 
programme, it is a positive externality flowing out from the programme  that provides assured 
revenues to the Government of India. It is estimated that the 641 signed APAs have resulted in 
bringing finality in taxation to income of about Rs. 25,000 crore s5. This translates into a payment of 
tax of about Rs. 7,500 Crore s5. This is litigation -free and does not give rise to appellate proceedings. 
Though the APA programme has been successful in enabling a positive economic environment for 
multinationals doing business in India, t he Government is committed to increase the efficacy of the 
programme further by providing it with adequate resources.
