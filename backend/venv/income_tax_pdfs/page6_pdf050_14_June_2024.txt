Suggested Activities 
Yoga in Space 
The celebration of yoga in space would stand as a testament to India's profound heritage, scientific prowess, 
sofl power, and dedication \0 holistic well-being. Here are some actionable ideas to commemorate lDY-
2024, 
1) All the space agencies across Ihe glolx may perform Yoga with the sunrise at their respective space 
stations. With the moveme nt of the sun, the Space Agencies would welcome/salute Sun through the 
celebration of Yoga. Though the world is divided by numerous ideologies, belief systems, this 
celebration would demonslrate how, every country celebrates this ancient wisdom of Yoga-thereby 
effeclivelyechoing the messageofVasudaiva Kutumbakam-an integral aspect of Indian philosophy. 
2) With India's prowess in science and technology, Indian scientists and organizations are renowned 
across the world. Numerous countries and organizations are already collaborating with Indian Space 
Research Organisation (ISRO), showcasing India's willingness tocollaborateand share its expertise. 
The astronauts aboard Internation al Space Station, assembled and maintained in iJle low Earth orbit 
by a collaboration of five space agencies may join us in the celebration of I DY-2024 by practicing 
some CYP asanas (if not the entire 45-rninute protocol). This could further be incorporate into their 
routine and would showcase India's cultural influence on aglobal scale. 
3) All astronauts associated with Space Exploration Projects or who have been to the International 
Space Station particularly the scientist,> ofIndian origin, such as Ms. Sunila Williams, may be invited 
by their respective space agencies or through other fonnal channels to join liS for the Yoga celebration 
this year. 
4) Additionally, considering the potential benefits, of yoga, a Yoga Protocol may later be introduced in 
the Space travellraining regimen. 
5) Astronauts selected for the Gaganyaan Mission may practice the Common Yoga Protocol. inspiring 
Ihe youth of the nation aspiring to be astronauts and scientists. Later. with the inclusion of Yoga 
Protocol in their regime. if any. we'll be able to examine the effects of Yoga in addition to theirregular 
trainings with the Gaganyaan project's implementation. 
6) Chandrayaan project." scientists may be at the forefront of the International Day of Yoga-2024 
celebration s. This would not only emphasize India's expertise in space science but will also highlight 
women power of India as more than 100 women played a direct role in the Chandrayaan-3 mission at 
ISRO. 
7) Retired sciemists at variolls space centers across the globe, may be requested by (heir respective 
space agencies to participate in this mission of health and well-being. 
8) Navigation satellites develope d by ISRO such as 'Navik' and communication satellites have the 
potentiaito raise awareness about International Day of Yoga (lOY) in neighboring coumries. With 
this, we can extend the reach of lOY initiatives beyond national borders through India's technology 
developed in space to promote lhe universal benefits of yoga to a wider audience. Addilionally, Space 
data cenlers, such as those in Fiji and India, can be utilized to raise awareness and ultimately promote 
Yoga.

Common Yoga Protocol (CYP), a specified sequence of Yoga practice of 45 minutes, lies at the heart of the 
IDYobservation. 
It was developed by some of the mosl accomplished Yoga gurus of India in 2015. Conceived with the need to 
organize harmonious mass Yoga demonstrations in observance of International Day of Yoga (IDY), it 
comprises the ideal assemblage of asanas for inducting beginners to Yoga practice. It was designed 
meticLllously so that people from variolls age groups and all walks of life can participate and reap the health 
benefits of Yoga. In a short span of nine years, CYP has emerged as one of the most popular introducto ry 
programmes for new learners of Yoga. 
It is also prepared to disseminate awareness of Yoga among the common peoplc. On the International Day of 
Yoga (i.e., 21" of June), the Common Yoga Protocol is normally performed in groups [rom 07:00am to 07:45 
am, the organizers of the event may follow any suitable and customized IS-minute programme, which could 
be a Yoga drill, speech, prayer etc. Thus, the lOY observat ion is a I-hour activity from 07.00 am to08.00am. 
Sincc the focus of lOY would be on group Yoga 
demonstrations based on CYP, organizers of each 
IDY event may take efforts to familiarize the 
intended participants/general public with CYP well 
in advance. CYP being a 45 minutes -long activity, 
is estimated by experts to ideally require 15 hours of 
training (preferably one hour per day) to learn. 
However. even with about 5 hours of 
familiarization, one can join the CYP demonstration 
in the spirit of participation. All stakeholders and 
organizers, therefore, include CYP trainingl 
learning as an important activity in the preparatory 
efforts of lOY. It is seen [rom the experience of the 
last nine years that many of those who learn CYP in 
the spirit of participation in IDY continue to practice 
the same even beyond Ute lDY Thus. participation 
in lOY becomes a starting point for the regular 
pursuitofYoga . 
The PDF versions of the CYP booklet are available in English and Hindi on MoA's Yoga Portal 
(https://yoga.ayush.gov.in/YAP/Home.php), which can easily be downloaded from the following links-

How is IDY observed? 
The UN resolution on lDY calls upon all countries, intemarional and regional organizations, as well as civil 
society, including individuals. to observe the International Day of Yoga raise awareness of the benefits of 
practicing yoga. The observation of IDY has been structured to be in alignment with the UN resolution. 
Considering that yoga provides a holistic approach to health and well-being, wider dissemination of 
infonna{ion aboullhe benefits of practicing yoga would be beneficial for the health of the world population, 
and some standard procedures for IDY observation have been designed accordingly. The activities of IDY 
are designed in such a way that the imerest oflhe participants ill pursuing Yoga does nol end with the lDY, but 
sustains even beyond. It has been observed that a notable number of people among the thousand s who start 
learning CYP in the spirit of participation in lOY continue to pursue Yoga even beyondIDY. 
In India, the activity at the heart of IDY observati on is the harmonious demonstration/performance of Yoga 
based on the COnllllon Yoga Protocol (CYP), the latter being a specified sequence ofVogl:t practices of about 
45 minulesduration. Vou may read l11oreabout CYP in the next section of this Handbook. 
On the International Day of Yoga, the lOY observation is normally a I-hour activity from 07:00 am to 08:00 
am. The CYP is nonnally performed from 07:00 am to 07:45 am. After 07:45 am, the organizers of the event 
(or the individuals joining from their homes) may follow any suitable and customized IS-minute 
programme, which could be a Yoga drill, speech, prayerctc. The activity conciudesat08:00 am. 
The option of following the CVP practice from nalional television on 21" June is also open, and this has the 
advantage of enabling all the Yoga-followers of the entire country to be in harmony to mark the lDY.

A. What is IDY and how is it observed? 
Recognizing the universal appeal of Yoga, owing to its demonstrated benefits for health and towards 
stress-relief, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) proclaimed 21" June as the 
International Day of Yoga (IDY) Oil I I III December 20 14, by resolution 691131 (shared as Appendix I 
in Section J). The dran resolution establishing lOY was proposed by India and endorsed by a record 175 
Member States. The proposal was first inlroduced by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, in his address 
during the opening of the 69'h session of [he General Assembly , in which he said, "Yoga is an invaluable gift 
from our ancient tradilion. Yoga embodies ullity of mind and body, thought and action-a holistic approach 
that is valuable to our heahh and our we11·bcing. Yoga is not just about exercise; it is a way to discover the 
sense of oneness with yourself, the world, and the nalUre." 
Since 2015, this day has been observed worldwide with an ever·growing number of participants. Observing 
lOY encourages individuals to make healthier choices such as pntclicing yoga and adopting lifestyle patterns 
that promote good health. In this regard, the World Health Organization has urged its member states to help 
their citizens reduce physical inactivity, which is among the top ten leading causes of death worldwide. and a 
key risk factor for non·communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer. and diabetes. Thus, 
observing roy provides an opportunity [Q raise global awareness about the health and wcll·being benefits of 
yoga and [Q build lasting public interest by highlighting how these benefits can be achieved through relatively 
easy and cost·effectivc efforts. 
As the nodal Ministry, the Ministry of Ayush (MoA) has been actively collaborating with a multitude of 
stakeholders from different domains in this endeavour, championing the cause of Yoga for the betterment of 
the health and well·being ofthecommunity.

Preface 
21" June was recognized as the Internationa l Day of Yoga (lOY) by the United Nations General 
Assembly (UNGA) in December 2014 at the initiative of Hon'hle Prime Minister of fndia. The lOY 
Resolution (Appendix I in Section J) moved by India secured unanimous consent, which was a record 
in itself. Since 2015, the lOY has been an occasion that is observed around the wortd with great enthusiasm 
and fervor. 
The observance of the Day is not rokenistic but serves the purpose of highlighting the immense potential of 
Yoga to enhance the physical, psychological, and emotional aspects of wellbeing. lDY over the years has not 
only boosled Yoga's popularity but also expanded its geographical presence by inspiring its adoption in 
several new tenitories. The event has also triggered new advances within the field of Yoga, such as the 
development of universal Yoga protocols for people of all ages, the developm ent of specific protocols 
addressing lifestyle diseases, and research in clcvcloping Yoga as a potential productivity-enhancing tool. 
In India, the Ministry of Ayush (MoA) (hups:l/ayush.gov.in) plays a nodal role every year in the mobiliz.ation 
of efforts for the observance of lOY, however, the endeavor to drive awareness and adoption of Yoga 
worldwide cannot be achieved working alone. Throughout the past nine years of IDY observance, 
partnersh ips forged by thc Ministry with key stakeholders like other Central Ministries, StatesfUTs, Leading 
Yoga institutions, Yoga Centers. Independ ent Practitioners, Educational Institutions, Non-Government al 
Organizations, and other Civil Society Organizations havc been critical in the success achieved in inspiring 
an increasingly larger number of people to participate in IDY each year. These stakeholders made valuable 
contributions in promoting the spiril of participation in IDY on a wide scale, thus converting lOY into a mass 
moveme nt for health. 
MoA is releasing the revised version of the IDY Handbook containing reference material for organizers of 
promotional activities for IDY-2024, to enable faster, easier, and smoother planning and implementation of 
lOY activities. The Handbook through standardization of activities will also help to strengthen 
collaborations among different stakeholders in organizing activities for IDY-2024. The reference material 
provided herein will enable the organizers to adopt a systematic approach, thus widening Ihe net of pOle nlia I 
participants and facilitating the inclusion of a larger number of stakeholders .. The Handbook is structured 10 
provide a background on IDY, its significance, past achievements and the importance of the Common Yoga 
Protocol (CYP). II will indicate how individuals and institutions can participate to make lDY a tl1.lly 
universal event. The Ministry has also included a list of publicly accessible digital resources thm organizers

The Ministry is continually striving to innovate and deepen its relationships with the various stakeholders of 
lDY, which is essential to creating a sustainable impact that extends beyond the day of lDY celebration. 
Consequently, the Ministry invites stakeholders to engage in discussions with us to explore potential 
additional initiatives thai can be undertaken collaboratively. To facilitate this and explore how the Ministry 
can collaborate with your esteemed institution. you can contact Smt. Vijayalakshmi Bharadwaj, Director,
