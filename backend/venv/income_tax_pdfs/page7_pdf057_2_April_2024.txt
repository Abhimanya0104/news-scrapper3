Sub: Regularization of Casual Workers in light of Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of India Judgement dated 3.7.2023 in the case of SLP (C) 
No.7898/2020 Raman Kumar & Ors.Vs.UOI&Ors 
Kindly refer to the above mentioned subject. 
2. In this regard, this office had referred the matter for seeking opinion/advice 
of the DoPT regarding implementation of order dated 03.07.2023 passed by the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of SLP (C) No.7898/2020 Raman 
Kumar & Ors. Vs. UOI & Ors read with Uma Devi and M.L.Kesari judgements in 
rem across various CCA Charges of the Department so as to have a uniform 
approach and also to avoid unnecessary litigation on the issue. 
3. The DoPT has agreed to the proposal to implement the aforesaid decision 
of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in rem subject to the following conditions: 
(i) The CCAs shall ensure that all such similarly placed casual workers satisfy the 
mandatory conditions for regularisation under the Uma Devi Judgment such as 
being duly qualified as per extant guidelines etc .. 
(ii) The casual workers had been working against the sanctioned posts for ten 
years or more on the date of Uma Devi Judgment i.e. 10.04.2006 but not under 
cover of Orders of Courts or Tribunals . 
4. The DoPT has further agreed to the proposal that in view of the fact that all 
the erstwhile Group D posts had been upgraded to Group C posts and recruitment 
to erstwhile Group 'D' posts, placed in Group 'C', PB-1, Grade Pay 1800/-(non­
technical as MT Staff), is now made only through Staff Selection Commission, 
therefore, the Department may regularize the eligible casual workers in Group D 
cadre and then subsequently merge them into MTS cadre in pursuance to the 
DoPT's O.M. No. AB-14017/6/2009-Estt(RR) dated 30.04.2010 and O.M. No. AB-
14017/39/2013-Estt. (RR) dated 23.12.2013 .
