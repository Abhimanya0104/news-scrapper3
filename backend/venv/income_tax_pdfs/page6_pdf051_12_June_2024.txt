Trade and Industry Association s  
 
Subject: Suggestions from the Industry and Trade Associations for Budget 202 4-25 
regarding changes in direct and indirect taxes.  
 
Sir/Madam,  
 
In the context of formulating the proposals for the Union Budget of 2024-25, the Ministry 
of Finance would like to be benefited by the suggestions and views of your Association.  You may 
like to send your suggestions for changes in the duty structure, rates and broadening of tax base 
on both direct and indirect taxes giving economic justification for the same.  
    
2. Your suggestions and views may be supplemented and justified by relevant statistical 
information about production, prices, revenue implication of the changes suggested and any other 
information to support your proposal.  The request for correction of inver ted duty structure, if any 
for a commodity, should necessarily be supported by value addition at each stage of manufacturing 
of the commodity. It would not be feasible to examine suggestions that are either not clearly 
explained or which are not supported by adequate justification / statistics.  
 
3. As can be seen that the Government policy with reference to direct taxes in the medium 
term is to phase out tax incentives, deductions and exemptions while simultaneously rationalising 
the rates of tax. It would be also desirable that while forwarding the suggestions/ recommendations 
positive externalities arising out of the said recommendations and their quantification are also 
indicated.  You may also like to give your suggestions for reducing compliances, for providing tax 
certainty and reducing litiga tions. The Synopsis of your suggestions could be given in the 
following format:  
 
 
S.No.  Issue  Justification
