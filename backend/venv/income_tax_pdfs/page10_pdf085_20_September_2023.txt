2 Sub : Screening Criteria adopted by the Screening Committee for Young Professional Schemne.-reg. File No. 
1, The meeting of Screening Committee constituted for the Young Professional Scherne by Office Order No. 08/2023-24 of the Office of Pr.CCIT West Bengal & Sikkim dated 30.08.2023, was held on 12.09.2023 at the Conference Hall, Aayakar Bhavan, Chowringhee 
3 In the meeting the memberS discussed the eligibility criteria, the essential qualification and preferred qualification as laid out in the Young Professional Scheme and it 
was decided unanimously that the applicants who do not meet the eligibility criteria as per CBDT's guidelines and instructions published in the advertisement by the Department would not be considered by the committee for shortlisting for interview. Further, due to the 
substantially high number of applicants after the screening as per the mentioned criteria 
the committee decided that only the applicants who possess the Preferred qualification criteria (such as relevant experience of taxation) as specified in the Scheme Document 
would be considered for short listing. The mnembers further noted that several applicants 
reside or work at places far away from Kolkata, and it would be highly challenging for the 
applicants to appear for interview or shift to Kolkata to work as a Young Professional if 
selected. In the light of this, it was decided by the Committee that for applicants with 
similar profile, preference for shortlisting would be given to candidates who reside or work 
in and around the West Bengal & Sikkim Region. 
In view of the above, the members devised the following screening criteria for 
screening the applications received and shortlisting candidates for interview: 
All applicants that do not meet the Eligibility criteria such as Age Limit and the 
Essential Qualifications as specified in the Scheme Document would not be considered 
by the committee for shortlisting. 
Application received after the due date i.e. 10.09.2023, as specified in the 
advertisement published by the department, would also not be considered for 
shortlisting. 
Applications that were received without duly filled up Application Form would also not 
be considered by the screening committee for shortlisting. 
Applicants, who do not possess the Preferred qualification criteria (such as relevant 
experience of taxation) as specified in the Scheme Document, would not be considered for shortlisting. 
In case of applicants with similar profile, preference for shortlisting would be given to 
candidates who reside or work in and around the West Bengal & Sikkim region. 
The screening criteria, as outlined in para 3 above, are put up betore your good self 
for your kind perusal and approval.
