. '. Foreword by the Chairman, CBDT 
The Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) programme of the CBDT, is one of its 
leading programmes for fostering a tax regime in India that provides an investor 
conducive environment. 516 APAs have been entered into by the CBDT till 
March, 2023, which demonstrates the widespread acceptance of the 
programme by taxpayers and stakeholders alike. This year witnessed the 
highest number of APA signings in any single year since the commencement of 
the APA programme . 
Over more than a decade long period of its existence , the APA programme has 
contributed significantly to the Government of India's mission of promoting ease 
of doing business, especially for MNEs, which have transactions spanning 
across borders, within their group entities. Each signed APA brings tax certainty 
for a taxpayer that spans multiple years. The number of APAs signed till date 
have cumulatively brought about certainty for more than 3,200 Assessment 
Years. 
Apart from running the Unilateral leg of the APA programme successfully, the 
CBDT has also actively engaged with its various tax treaty partners to negotiate 
and enter into Bilateral APAs, which provide taxpayers an added benefit of 
relieving double taxation. The record number of bilateral agreements signed this 
year is a testament to the strengthening of our relationship with taxpayers and 
treaty partners. 
As we release this Report, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the 
hard work and dedication of the officers in the Foreign Tax & Tax Research 
Division of the CBDT and the officers in the APA teams under Principal CCIT 
(International Taxation) . My appreciation to taxpayers for being equal and active 
partners in this programme . CBDT will continue to strive towards further 
increasing the efficacy of the APA programme and take it forward to greater 
heights. Feedback/suggestions on the Report are welcome , which will help us 
in identifying how we can further strengthen the APA programme .

. , Preface by Member (L), CBOT 
The Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) programme was introduced in India through Finance 
Act, 2012 with a view to fulfil the objectives of tax certainty and double taxation avoidance ­
two key focus areas of the CBDT for several years now. Being founded on principles of mutual 
co-operation and trust between taxpayers and revenue authorities, the programme has 
strengthened the Indian tax administration's orientation of enabling and empowering the 
growth of our taxpayers. 
The programme has constantly strived for a meticulous, positive, fact-intensive and 
collaborative perspective on transfer pricing. Thus, a more cooperative rather than adversarial 
approach, forms the cornerstone of the APA programme. 
It gives me immense pleasure to present this fifth Annual Report (for FY 2022-23) of the Indian 
AP A programme. This Annual Report presents abundant numerical data and detailed analysis 
that confirms the immense popularity and acceptability of the AP A programme in India. The 
year FY 2022-23 in particular has been one of resounding success for the programme with 
several milestones in terms of number of signings surpassed. 
I would like to appreciate the efforts put in by the officers in the Foreign Tax & Tax Research 
Division of the CBDT and the officers in the APA teams under Principal CCIT (International 
Taxation) to make this programme a success. The financial year has been a record-breaking 
year for the AP A programme in many respects, be it the highest number of signings in any year 
in the history of the programme or record single day signings, for which I would like to put on 
record my special appreciation for the dedication and hard work of the officers, as well as the 
positive support extended by taxpayers and tax consultants. I would specifically also like to 
thank our taxpayers for reposing their faith in the APA programme and extending their ful\­
fledged cooperation in ensuring that the programme continues to be a success.

 Chapter 1: APA Programme of India – Introduction  
 
An Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) is an agreement between the tax administration and a 
person (taxpayer), which determines, in advance, the Arm’s Length Price (ALP) or specifies 
the manner of the determination of ALP (or both), in relation to an international transaction1. 
APA programmes are operational in a number of countries for a long time. The primary goal 
of such programmes is to provide certainty to taxpayers in respect of the pricing of cross-border 
transactions undertaken by taxpayers with their group entities.  
Unprecedented growth in international trade involving cross-border transactions within group 
entities has given rise to numerous tax disputes on the issue of transfer pricing. An APA is a 
mechanism to resolve transfer pricing disputes in advance, i.e., before the cross-border related 
party transaction actually takes place or, at least, before a dispute arises in respect of such cross-
border transaction. The transfer price of goods and services transacted between group entities 
is decided in advance by the tax authorities and the taxpayers, so as to prevent any dispute 
arising from such transfer pricing.  
The APA programme in India was launched in 2012 vide the Finance Act, 2012 through the 
insertion of sections 92CC and 92CD in the Income-tax Act, 1961. These statutory provisions, 
effective from 1st July, 2012, lent the legal backing to the CBDT to enter into APAs with 
taxpayers for a maximum period of 5 years in respect of international transactions between 
Associated Enterprises (AEs) to determine the ALP or to specify the manner in which the ALP 
is to be determined.  
Vide notification no. 36/2012 [F. No. 133/5/2012-SO(TPL)]/SO 2005 (E), dated 30th August, 
2012, the APA Scheme [Rules 10F to 10T] was inserted in the Income-tax Rules, 1962 to 
operationalize the APA programme. Thus, the Indian APA programme, which commenced 
from 1st July, 2012, became functional and operational from 30th August, 2012 with the 
notification of the rules. The rules deal with the various procedural aspects of the APA process, 
including procedures for filing of pre-filing consultation application; pre-filing consultation; 
payments of fees; filing of APA application; processing of APA application; withdrawal of 
APA application; terms and conditions of APA; filing of Annual Compliance Report; 
Compliance Audit; revision, cancellation and renewal of APA; etc.

 Rollback provisions allow the ALP or the methodology for determining the ALP as agreed to 
in the APA, to be rolled back to a period prior to the commencement of the APA. Roll-back of 
APAs was announced by the Government on 10th July, 2014. The necessary legislative 
changes in this regard were carried out through the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2014. The amendment 
to the Income-tax Rules, 1962 for implementing the Roll-back provisions were notified on 14th  
March, 2015 and the existing APA Scheme got amended accordingly. The Rollback provisions 
are applicable for a maximum of four years prior to the first year of the APA period. Thus, a 
taxpayer would be able to have certainty in matters of transfer pricing for a maximum period 
of 9 years at any one time by applying for an APA with Rollback provisions. Circular No. 10 
of 2015 was issued by the CBDT on 10th June, 2015 to provide clarity on Rollback issues in 
the form of answers to FAQs.  
Under the Indian APA programme, APAs can be bilateral (involving CBDT and the tax 
authorities of another country) or unilateral (involving the CBDT only). Over the last 11 years, 
more than 1600 applications have been filed in India. About 75% of these are for unilateral 
APAs between the Indian taxpayer and the CBDT. Till 31st March, 2023, 516 Agreements have 
been entered into (420 unilateral and 96 bilateral).  
The APA applications are processed and analysed by dedicated APA teams working under the 
overall supervision of Pr. CCIT (International Taxation), New Delhi. Each APA team is headed 
by a Commissioner of Income-tax. The team also comprises Addl./Joint Commissioners of 
Income-tax and Deputy/Asst. Commissioners of Income-tax. Presently, there are four APA 
teams. These teams are based in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. A new APA team has been 
constituted in this financial year in Gurugram, to further streamline processing of APAs.  
In respect of unilateral APAs (UAPAs), the position papers developed by the APA teams are 
approved by the Pr. CCIT (International Taxation), New Delhi and sent to the CBDT for 
approval. In the CBDT, officers of the Foreign Tax & Tax Research (FT & TR-I and II) 
Divisions examine and process the position papers. Joint Secretary, FT & TR-I and FT & TR-
II review the examination done by the officers below and further process the position papers 
before sending it for final approval of the designated Member of the CBDT. The Member 
approves the final negotiating position to be adopted by the APA teams. Once the negotiation 
is complete, a draft Agreement is sent to the CBDT for approval. Thereafter, the Agreement is 
entered into between the CBDT and the taxpayer.

 In respect of bilateral APAs (BAPAs), once the position papers are sent to the FT & TR-I & II 
Divisions by the Pr. CCIT (International Taxation), the Competent Authority of India (either 
Joint Secretary, FT & TR-I or Joint Secretary, FT & TR-II, depending upon the country with 
which the bilateral APA is to be negotiated under the Tax Treaty) initiates discussions with 
their counterpart in the other country. The officers in the FT & TR Division of the CBDT 
working with the Competent Authority examine the position paper received from the Pr.CCIT 
(International Taxation) and prepare the position of the Indian Competent Authority. The same 
is shared with the Competent Authority of the other country. Once positions have been 
exchanged, the Competent Authorities of both countries discuss and negotiate the terms and 
conditions of the APA. If they reach an understanding, then a Mutual Agreement, containing 
the terms and conditions of the APA, is entered into by the Competent Authorities of both 
countries. Thereafter, each country usually enters into an Agreement with its own taxpayer. On 
the Indian side, the Mutual Agreement is shared with the taxpayer and its concurrence is sought 
within 30 days. Once the taxpayer agrees to the resolution reached in the Mutual Agreement, a 
draft Agreement is prepared in consultation with the Indian taxpayer and the same is submitted 
for the approval of the designated Member in the CBDT.  
For both UAPAs and BAPAs, the Agreements are entered into by either Joint Secretary, FT & 
TR-I or Joint Secretary, FT & TR-II (the two Competent Authorities of India) with the 
taxpayer, on behalf of the CBDT.  
The fifth Annual Report on the APA programme highlights the progress made in financial year 
2022-23. This has been a landmark year for the APA programme. This year, CBDT recorded 
the highest ever APA signings in any financial year since the launch of the APA programme, 
signing a total of 95 APAs. This year, CBDT also signed the maximum number of BAPAs in 
any financial year till date, with the signing on 32 BAPAs. The BAPAs were signed as a 
consequence of entering into Mutual Agreements with India’s treaty partners namely Finland, 
the UK, the US, Denmark, Singapore, and Japan. A record of the largest number of single day 
signings in the history of the programme was also created with a total of 21 APAs signed on 
24th March, 2023.This was possible due to the efforts of the CBDT and its officers working in 
the Foreign Tax & Tax Research Division and in the APA teams [under the Principal CCIT 
(International Taxation)]. The CBDT also acknowledges the cooperation and efforts of the 
taxpayers and their consultants in making the APA programme a success.

 This Annual Report carries forward the CBDT’s unique initiative to bring into the public 
domain various statistical and qualitative aspects of India’s APA programme. The idea is to 
encourage discussion and debate amongst taxpayers, policy makers, and economists, among 
others, on the strengths and weaknesses of the programme. This Annual Report also underlines 
the importance that the APA programme holds in the Government’s endeavour to promote and 
preserve a non-adversarial tax regime.

 Chapter 2: Data and Qualitative Analyses  
 
2.1 Applications filed  
The total number of applications filed on an annual basis can be seen from Table 2-1 and Figure 
2-1 below. The total number of applications remained largely consistent from FY 2017-18 to 
FY 2019-20 before a sharp drop in FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22. However, the number of 
filings bounced back in FY 2022-23, driven primarily by the highest number of BAPA filings 
ever. Although premature to declare this as a trend based on one year, the shift towards BAPAs 
indicates confidence in the quick and efficient resolutions with many of our treaty partners.

 2.3 Agreements signed: Year-wise  
The number of agreements signed in various years of the APA programme are detailed in Table 
2-3 and Figure 2-3 below. While there was a significant fall in the number of APAs signed in 
FY 2020-21, mainly due to the CoVID-19 pandemic, the APA programme bounced back in 
FY 2021-22, and hit a record high in FY 2022-23. The highest number of BAPAs ever were 
signed in this year. Additionally, signing of the 400th UAPA and the 500th APA were also 
milestones achieved in this year.

 2.4 Total covered years in Agreements signed  
The impact of the APA programme in increasing the ease of doing business is evident from the 
number of years for which it has brought certainty in transfer pricing matters and reduced 
litigation. In its short period of existence in India, the APA programme has cumulatively 
brought about certainty for over 3200 years.

The APA programme is also an important tool to decongest the tax tribunals and higher 
judiciary of transfer pricing litigation. Even if we assume that only about half of these 
assessment years would have ended up in litigation, the APA programme has managed to 
prevent or resolve this litigation for more than 1600 assessment years, in other words more 
than 1600 transfer pricing matters related appeals. During the last financial year itself, the  APA 
programme has provided tax certainty to more than 500 assessment years annually.

3.2 Status of Applications Filed  
The number of UAPAs disposed off and number of UAPAs still under processing are detailed 
in Table 3-2 and Figure 3-2 below. The disposal in earlier years is high while number of cases 
still under processing is low. For recent years, a large proportion of cases are still under 
processing. Reason for this is that processing of APAs involves conducting site visits, various 
due diligence processes, and multiple rounds of negotiations, all of which take time. More than 
20% of the applications under processing pertain to applications filed in March 2023 and so 
the processing is at a preliminary stage.

3.4 Duration of Processing  
The number of UAPAs signed in FY 2022-23 segregated on the basis of duration taken from 
application to signing are mentioned in Table 3-4-1 below. It is seen that the average duration 
for closure of applications in FY 2022-23 is approximately 59.73 months. The average duration 
of processing on a cumulative basis is approximately 44.2 months. In the recent years, the focus 
of the APA programme has been on closure of backlog as well as more complex cases. The 
average duration of processing of cases in FY 2022-23, when compared to cumulative figure, 
highlights the impact of these factors.  535380

3.5 Sectoral distribution of applicants  
The primary economic activity of applicants in whose cases UAPAs were signed in FY 2022-
23 are mentioned in Table 3-5 below. As can be seen, a majority of applications which 
culminated into agreement in FY 2022-23 pertain to the service sector. A majority of these, in 
turn, are captive companies involved in software development and IT enabled services. Some 
of these companies are also involved in engineering design services, contract R&D services, 
and Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO). It may be noted that 14 out of the 63 companies 
with which CBDT entered into agreements also have manufacturing activities. Further, 11 out 
of 63 companies are involved in trading activities. Hence, the entire spectrum of trading, 
manufacturing, and services, are covered under UAPAs signed.

 3.6 Industry-wise distribution of agreements  
A majority of UAPAs signed in the financial year 2022-23 pertain to the I-T industry, banking 
& insurance, and engineering services. This reflects on the fact that India is a major outsourcing 
destination for information technology and business processes, and significant number of 
foreign MNEs have presence in I-T clusters of India such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, 
Gurgaon, and Noida. The pharmaceutical/chemical industry has also been increasingly 
reflected in the APAs signed, mirroring the importance of the Indian pharmaceutical industry 
globally. The industry wise distribution of UAPAs is as given in Table 3-6 and Figure 3-6 
below.

 3.7 Nature of Transactions Covered  
The nature of the 267 international transactions covered by the 63 UAPAs signed in FY 2022-
23 are mentioned in Table 3-7 and Figure 3-7 below. As can be seen from the table, a wide 
variety of transactions have been covered by the UAPAs signed in this year. A diversified 
basket of international transactions indicates the maturity of the APA programme and 
competence of the APA teams in processing applications that include complex transactions.  
While captive services like SWD services and ITeS services are usually benchmarked at cost 
plus a mark-up under the Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM), the determination of 
arm’s length price for manufacturing, royalty transactions, IGS, etc.  is more intricate. Some 
complex transactions need to be benchmarked using multiple methods (a primary method and 
a secondary method for sanity check).

 3.9 Location of AEs  
The 63 UAPAs entered into in the financial year have AEs across 130 countries, as given in 
Table 3-9 below. Usually, a single APA covers AEs located in multiple jurisdictions. The 
transactions with these AEs could be the primary covered international transaction, or a closely 
linked transaction like reimbursement/recovery of expenses, etc. In a majority of cases, AEs 
are located in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, etc. The APA 
applicants are usually a part of MNE groups, whose parent jurisdictions are in these countries. 
Many AEs are also located in investment and business hubs such as Singapore, Hong Kong, 
and Ireland.

Chapter 4: Bilateral APAs  
 
4.1 Applications Filed  
BAPA applications filed in various years, and UAPA applications filed in various years but 
subsequently converted into BAPA applications are detailed in Table 4-1. This financial year 
has been a landmark year in BAPA filings, with 77 new applications being received. This 
demonstrates the trust reposed in the bilateral process by our taxpayers, and reflects deeper 
relationships with our treaty partners, leading to quicker resolutions.

The Table 4-5 and Figure 4-5 below show the year-wise details of BAPAs entered into till 31st 
March, 2023. As can be seen below, almost a three-fold increase in signing of BAPAs was 
achieved in FY 2022-23. This stellar performance was possible due to increasing frequency of 
communication with treaty partners, streamlined efforts by officers, and maturity of the APA 
programme.  
In FY 2022-23, out of the 32 Agreements signed with taxpayers, 22 pertained to the USA, 3 to 
Finland, and 2 each to the UK, Singapore, and Denmark, while 1 pertained to Japan.  45

4.6 Duration of Processing  
In FY 2022-23, the average time taken to conclude BAPAs has come down to approximately 
62.1 months. The detailed analysis of this is depicted in Table 4-6-1 and Figure 4-6-1 below. 
With hard-fought negotiations with treaty partners longstanding BAPAs were successfully 
concluded in this year which however led to a high average processing time for the year. 
However, there was a simultaneous focus on quick resolution of renewals in order to leverage 
the due diligence done while processing original applications and ensure movement in a mixed-
basket of cases. This has reduced the average time taken for all BAPAs concluded till 31st 
March, 2023 marginally from 58.91 months (as on 31st March, 2022) to approximately 58.77 0128911

 months. A number of BAPAs are actually resolved much before they are finally signed. 
However, due to several reasons such as the desire of the Applicants to conclude both the 
unilateral and bilateral legs of the application together, the Applicant waiting to clear the draft 
of agreements through multiple levels of internal approvals etc., the formal signing takes longer 
even after bilateral resolution, which increases the final duration of processing of BAPAs.

4.11 Renewal of BAPAs  
 
An overwhelming majority of the applicants who have signed a BAPA with the CBDT have 
opted to file a renewal. This shows the trust reposed by the taxpayers in the APA programme 
and the preference for obtaining advance certainty rather than undergoing possible TP litigation 
and its related costs. Out of the 96 BAPAs signed till 31.03.2023, 63 applicants have opted for 
a renewal of the APA till date.

 Chapter 5: Other dispute resolution processes  
 
BAPAs are a special type of dispute prevention/resolution process between two treaty partners. 
Another dispute resolution channel available under India’s Double Taxation Avoidance 
Agreements (DTAAs) is the Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP). It is an alternate dispute 
resolution process involving two treaty partners, that seeks to remove taxation not in 
accordance with the DTAA arising from action by one or both treaty partners. India participates 
in the FTA MAP Forum of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) and shares its MAP statistics with the Forum. The statistics are available in the public 
domain.  
MAP cases are negotiated by the Competent Authorities of India, namely the Joint Secretary 
(FT&TR-I) and Joint Secretary (FT&TR-II) in the CBDT, and other officers supporting them 
in this regard. MAP can be filed to avoid anticipated double taxation or resolve double taxation. 
The inventory of MAP cases in calendar years 2022as also reported under MAP statistics with 
the OECD is detailed in Table 5-1 below. As can be seen from the table, the number of MAP 
cases closed in 2022 are substantially more than the number of new MAP applications invoked. 
As a result, the total number of MAP in India’s inventory is gradually reducing.

*Opening inventory has been corrected by agreement with the respective treaty partners 
As can be seen from Figures 5-1 and 5-2, the number of cases being resolved under MAP has 
been steadily increasing with a corresponding decline in closing inventory. This is primarily 
due to the maturing of our relationships with treaty partners and efforts to increase frequency 
of communication with our treaty partners.

Conclusion 
 
The Indian APA programme is a very important part of CBDT’s efforts to enhance the ease of 
doing business in India and providing tax certainty to taxpayers. Since its commencement in 
July, 2012, the APA programme has resolved many complex transfer pricing issues which were 
prone to long drawn and expensive litigation.  
The Indian APA programme has successfully achieved resolutions that are beneficial to both 
taxpayers and the Government. While taxpayers have managed to get certainty over transfer 
pricing issues for five to nine years (depending upon whether rollback provisions are applicable 
to an Agreement), the Government has been able to streamline limited resources on more 
productive audits and other procedures.  
APAs are beneficial to the Government at the same time, by assuring tax revenues from 
multinationals on the basis of the terms and conditions embedded in the Agreements. Though 
revenue mobilisation has never been the primary objective of the Indian APA programme, it is 
a positive externality flowing out from the programme that provides assured revenues to the 
Government of India. It is estimated that the 516 signed APAs have resulted in bringing finality 
in taxation to income of about Rs. 19,000 crore. This translates into a payment of tax of about 
Rs. 7,000 Crore. This is litigation-free and does not give rise to appellate proceedings. Though 
the APA programme has been successful in enabling a positive economic environment for 
multinationals doing business in India, the Government is committed to increase the efficacy 
of the programme further by providing it with adequate resources.
