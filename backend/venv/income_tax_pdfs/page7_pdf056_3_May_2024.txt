centralization of ::icarch eases 
I am directed to refer to the above and to say that based upon the aforesaid guidelines dated 
17.09.2008 some of the CCslT have raised doubts as to whether only search cases can be 
eentraliledltransfcrred u/s 127 of the IT Act, 1961. 
2. The matter has been considered by the Board and it is clarified that the 
transfer/centralization of cases is done as [Jer provisions of section 127 of the Act which is not 
limited to transfer/centralization of only search cases. The above mentioned guidelines do not deal 
with centraliz:'ttion or transfer of non search cases uis 127 of the Act and are not intended to 
preclude centralization arnon-search c~~scs in Jny manner. 
3. \Vhilc it is neither feasible, nor desirable to dr<l"W an exhaustive list of categories of non~ 
search cases which may also be centralized, cases falling in the foliowing categories (only 
illustrative) could be considered for the purpose: 
l. Non-search cases co'nnected with the search cases where findings of the search have 
material bearing and needs of coordinated investigation/interest of revenue require such 
cases to be assessed in the Central Charge 
11. Survey cases or enquiry cases (whether sLlch enquiries were conducted by any wing of the 
department or an outside agency) wherein some organized/systematic manipulation of 
accounts/fraud/substantial revenue is 'involved and/or coordination with outsfde agencies or 
a Jarge number of officers \vithin the department is required 
iii. Cases arising out of a SC.o.:11 3.S 3 result of investigation/enquiry c.onducted by some· other
