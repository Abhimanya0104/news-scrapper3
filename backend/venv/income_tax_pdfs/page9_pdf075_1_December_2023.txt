North Block, the 1" December, 2023 
Order under section 119 of the Income-tax Act. 1961 
Subject: Processing of returns of income validly filed electronically with refund claims under 
section 143(1) ofthe Income-tax Act, 1961 beyond the prescribed time limits in non-scrutiny 
cases-regd. 
It has been brought to the notice of the Central Board of Direct Taxes ('Board') that 
due to certain technical issues or for other reasons not attributable to the asses sees concerned, 
several returns for assessment years (AYs) 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21, which were 
otherwise filed validly under section 139 or 142(1) or 119 of the Income tax Act, 1961 ('Act') 
could not be processed under sub-section (I) of section 143 of the Act. Consequently, 
intimation regarding processing of such returns could not be sent within the timeframe 
prescribed under sub-section (I) of section 143 of the Act. This has led to a situation where the 
taxpayers are unable to get their legitimate refund in accordance with provisions of the Act, 
although the delay may not be attributable to them. 
2. To resolve the grievances of such taxpayers, the Board had earlier issued 
instructions/orders U/S 119 of the Act from time to time relaxing the prescribed statutory time 
limit for processing of such validly filed returns with refund claims in non-scrutiny cases. As 
per the latest order dated 16th October, 2023, time frame was given tiIl31.01.2024 to process 
returns of income validly filed electronically with refund claims upto AY 2017-18. 
3. The matter has been considered by the Board in view of pending grievances of 
taxpayers related to issue of refund for AYs 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21. To mitigate 
genuine hardship being faced by the taxpayers on this issue, the Board, by virtue of powers 
vested with it under section 119 of the Act, hereby relaxes the time-frame prescribed in second 
proviso to sub-section (I) of section 143 and directs that all returns of income validly filed 
electronically with refund claims for AYs 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21, for which date of 
sending intimation under sub-section (I) of section 143 of the Act has lapsed, subject to the 
exceptions mentioned in para 5 below, can be processed now with prior administrative approval 
of Pr.CCIT/CCIT concerned. The intimation of such processing under sub-section (I) of 
section 143 of the Act can be sent to the assessee concerned by 31.01.2024. 
4. All subsequent effects under the Act including issue of refund shall also follow as per 
the prescribed procedures. To ensure adequate safeguards, it has been decided that once 
administrative approval is accorded by the Pr.CCIT/CCIT, the Pr.CIT/CIT concerned would 
make a reference to the DOlT (Systems) to provide necessary enablernent to the Assessing 
Officer on a case to case basis. The progress of disposal of such cases shall be monitored by 
the Pr.CIT/CIT concerned.
